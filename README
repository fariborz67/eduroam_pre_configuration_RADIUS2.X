14. Edit "/etc/raddb/radiusd.conf" and replace the local and federation server details as:

local_Proxy_Ip      = 127.0.0.1
Local_Proxy_secret  = secret
Local_Proxy_RMA     = no
Local_Proxy_NT      = other

In these parameters you have to replace with your eduroam federation proxy server drtails who accept request

Fed_1_Proxy_Ip      = X.Y.Z.W
Fed_1_Proxy_Secret  = secret
Fed_1_Proxy_Short   = eduroam-orps

Fed_2_Proxy_Ip      = X.Y.Z.W
Fed_2_Proxy_Secret  = secret
Fed_2_Proxy_Short   = eduroam-nrps

Fed_3_Proxy_Ip      = X.Y.Z.W
Fed_3_Proxy_Secret  = secret
Fed_3_Proxy_Short   = eduroam-site

In these parameters you have to replace with your eduroam clients that send request to your proxy e.g. access points

Client_1_Proxy_Ip      = 1.1.1.1
Client_1_Proxy_Secret  = secret
Client_1_Proxy_Short   = eduroam_client_1

Client_2_Proxy_Ip      = 1.1.1.2
Client_2_Proxy_Secret  = secret
Client_2_Proxy_Short   = eduroam_client_2

Client_3_Proxy_Ip      = 1.1.1.3
Client_3_Proxy_Secret  = secret
Client_3_Proxy_Short   = eduroam_client_3

15. Edit "/etc/raddb/radiusd.conf" and replace the local and federation server details as:
    	Replace "university.ac.uk" with your domain name and also home server IP address in parameters "ipaddr" and secret in "secret"
   
 		home_server university.ac.uk {
	       		type = auth
        		ipaddr =127.0.0.1
        		port = 1812
        		secret = secret110
	Replace "university.ac.uk" with your domain name
		
		realm university.ac.uk {
